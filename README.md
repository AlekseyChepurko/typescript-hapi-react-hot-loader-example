# `hapi-react-hot-loader-example`

## get started
1. $ `yarn`
2. $ `yarn dev`
3. http://localhost:3000

## dev tasks
- $ `yarn lint` (eslint)
- $ `yarn dev` (local development w/ server)

> Type `rs` with a carriage return to restart nodemon if you make changes to the files within `server-side`. It's not efficient to automatically restart nodemon on file changes.
